abstract = "The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is an ambitious 5-year effort to characterize brain connectivity and function and their variability in healthy adults. This review summarizes the data acquisition plans being implemented by a consortium of \{HCP\} investigators who will study a population of 1200 subjects (twins and their non-twin siblings) using multiple imaging modalities along with extensive behavioral and genetic data. The imaging modalities will include diffusion imaging (dMRI), resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI), task-evoked fMRI (T-fMRI), T1- and T2-weighted \{MRI\} for structural and myelin mapping, plus combined magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG). Given the importance of obtaining the best possible data quality, we discuss the efforts underway during the first two years of the grant (Phase I) to refine and optimize many aspects of \{HCP\} data acquisition, including a new 7T scanner, a customized 3T scanner, and improved \{MR\} pulse sequences.

Children move more than adults and this has led to concerns that developmental changes in resting-state connectivity measures may be artefactual. Furthermore, children are challenging to recruit into studies and therefore researchers have tended to take a permissive stance when setting exclusion criteria on head motion. The literature is not clear regarding our central question: How much motion is too much? Here, we systematically examine the effects of multiple motion exclusion criteria at different sample sizes and age ranges in a large openly available developmental cohort (ABIDE; http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide). We checked 1) the reliability of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) pairwise connectivity measures across the brain and 2) the accuracy with which we can separate participants with autism spectrum disorder from typically developing controls based on their rs-fMRI scans using machine learning. We find that reliability on average is primarily sensitive to the number of participants considered, but that increasingly permissive motion thresholds lower case-control prediction accuracy for all sample sizes.},

                 becoming increasingly prominent in the conduct of research.
                 PURPOSE: This paper reports on a quasi-experimental
                 longitudinal study conducted to compare bibliometric
                 indicators of scientific collaboration, productivity, and
                 impact of center-based transdisciplinary team science
                 initiatives and traditional investigator-initiated grants in
                 the same field. METHODS: All grants began between 1994 and
                 2004 and up to 10 years of publication data were collected for
                 each grant. Publication information was compiled and analyzed
                 during the spring and summer of 2010. RESULTS: Following an
                 initial lag period, the transdisciplinary research center
                 grants had higher overall publication rates than the
                 investigator-initiated R01 (NIH Research Project Grant
                 Program) grants. There were relatively uniform publication
                 rates across the research center grants compared to
                 dramatically dispersed publication rates among the R01 grants.
                 On average, publications produced by the research center
                 grants had greater numbers of coauthors but similar journal
                 impact factors compared with publications produced by the R01
                 grants. CONCLUSIONS: The lag in productivity among the
                 transdisciplinary center grants was offset by their overall
                 higher publication rates and average number of coauthors per
                 publication, relative to investigator-initiated grants, over
                 the 10-year comparison period. The findings suggest that
                 transdisciplinary center grants create benefits for both
                 scientific productivity and collaboration.",

                 hackathons and unconferences, as well as parallel educational
                 sessions, Brainhack fosters novel collaborations around the
                 interests of its attendees. Here we provide an overview of its
                 structure, past events, and example projects. Additionally, we
                 outline current innovations such as regional events and
                 post-conference publications. Through introducing Brainhack to
                 the wider neuroscience community, we hope to provide a unique
                 conference format that promotes the features of collaborative,
