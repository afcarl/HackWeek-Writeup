## Introduction

As data becomes cheaper to gather and store, research across a wide range of disciplines has become increasingly reliant on computational workflows involving a familiarity with aspects of statistical modeling, machine learning, scalable computation, and related skills.
At the same time, formal university curricula have been relatively slow to offer courses in these important topics: the slack in this area has often been picked-up by extra-curricular, third-party workshops.
A well-known example is the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops, whose interdisciplinary workshops in research computing skills have reached more than 16,000 participants since its inception in 1998 ([ref](https://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v2)).
At the same time, there has been a rise in the number of domain-specific summer schools focusing on statistics and computation within their field; in the Astronomy community, one of the longest-running has been at the Penn State Center for Astrostatistics, which in 2016 hosted the twelfth *Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers*, consisting of "intensive week covering basic statistical inference, several fields of applied statistics, and the R computing environment" ([source](http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su16/)).
Another model of extra-curricular meeting is less pedagogical and more project-focused, perhaps typified by the dotAstronomy meetings, a week-long conference series which focuses specifically on leveraging web technologies for novel applications in Astronomy ([ref](http://dotastronomy.com)).
Shorter, but similar-spirit meetings have started in conjunction with conferences, such Hack Days at the annual American Astronomical Society meetings, where Astronomers gather to work on short projects, both computational and non-computational in nature, or the Brainhack hackathons that take place in conjunction with meetings of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping and the Society for Neuroscience ([ref](https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13742-016-0121-x)).

In broad-brush, pedagogically-focused workshops and summer schools tend to follow a classic academic model where novices learn a skillset from experts, while project-focused workshops focus on people collaboratively exercising the skillset they already have.
A disadvantage of the summer school model is that it can tends to focus on a one-way flow of information from instructor to student, and can discount the potential contributions by students.
A disadvantage of the hackathon model is the common perception (whether accurate or not) that the week is designed for experts in technical tools, which may discourage others from attending.
In 2014, we started Astrohack week to try to fill the gaps between these models. The hack week model combines pedagogy (often focused on statistical and computational techniques) with room for collaborative hacks or creative projects, with the goal of encouraging collaboration and learning among people at various stages of their career.

As of the publication of this paper, we have run five such hack week events: three focused on Astronomy, one focused on Neuroscience, and one focused on Geophysics.
Below we will share some of the philosophy behind the hack week model, practical lessons we have learned in organizing these events, and recommendations for future hack weeks in other disciplines.


### What is a hackathon?

Hackathons are time-bounded, collaborative events that bring together participants around a shared challenge or learning objective [@Decker2015]. Hackathons have historically focused on software development and technology design as a way to motivate innovation within industry. In recent years, hackathons have expanded into a model for intensive short-term collaboration across disciplinary and topical boundaries. In addition, because of their focus on participatory engagement, hackathons provide numerous opportunities to 'learn by doing' within a constructivist educational framework [@Bransford2000-lu, @Papert1980-fh]. With this in mind, hackathons around scientific topics, designed to foster collaboration [@Groen2015-cj, @Moller2013-ah], or provide an opportunity to learn [@Kienzler2015-zu, @Lamers2014-xf], are becoming more common.

The recent surge in popularity of these events has resulted in a broad spectrum of ways to define the hackathon. Following the typology of [@Drouhard2017], we assert that core elements of all hackathons include opportunities for networking, the strengthening of social ties and the building of community connections, both within and across disciplines. Building on these core elements, there are various implementations of the hackathon concept with respect to the overall purpose, mode of participation, style of work environment and motivation [@Drouhard2017]. "Catalytic" hackathons seek novel project ideas aimed at solving a tractable, well-defined challenge. "Contributive" hackathons seek to improve to an existing effort through focused work on discrete tasks, for example to make up for deficiencies in an ongoing project. Finally, "Communal" hackathons place a strong focus on building a culture of practice and developing resources within an existing community, often defined by a specific domain of knowledge.

Our past hack week events most closely follow the communal hackathon model as it applies to scientific communities of practice. Our approach aims to combine structured, tutorial-style instruction with informal education and peer learning opportunities occurring within projects and hacks. Within the communal model we see these tools being implemented across a spectrum of approaches, the design of which depends on the specific characteristics of each community of practice (Figure 1). For example, the astronomy community is relatively small and has a foundation of shared approaches and software implementations, allowing for a greater focus on project work over formal tutorials. In contrast, both the neuro- and geoscience communities covered a broader range of sub-disciplines and had a less cohesive set of existing practices, calling for greater focus on tutorials and education.

We note that the terminology for these events is constantly evolving, and that the "hackathon" concept may have implicit connotations that are disfavored in some communities (see also below). One criticism of hackathons is that they propel the "geek" stereotype and may present a barrier to creating an inclusive working environment, especially for women [@Decker2015].


## Why run a Hack Week?

There are several reasons to run a hack week of the sort described here.

- Education and training: Some of these events are more focused on education on specific skills than others (see Figure \ref{fig:spectrum}). However, even those that are not explicitely focused on skills-development will include extensive discussions on reproducible and open science practices, providing participants who do not have experience with these concepts and tools with exposure to them. Because many of these issues relate to conventions and community norms, rather than skills, the discussion of these issues in a group setting, with a diverse set of community members, from different institutions lends these discussions additional effect, that would not be possible in discussions within any individual research group. Participants can then serve as "ambassadors" of these practices, to report back to their groups and departments about the practices they have seen, and their adoption by other researchers in the field. Furthermore, the kind of co-working that is inherent to the hack week format facilitates lateral knolwedge transfer -- learning from each other about practices and tools of the trade that are helpful in research in the field, but are not necessarily described in research products such as papers, or even in the software implementations. These can even be small "tricks of the trade" that participants can show each other, while they are working in the same project, or even side-by-side in the same space. Thus, even in the cases in which the focus of the event is not focused on specific learning objectives, it can still provide a platform for substantial learning.

- Tool development: hack weeks present an opportunity for computational tool developers to get together with users of these tools, and to critically evaluate the use of the tools in addressing particular scientific questions.

- Community building: a hack week is an opportunity to galvanize a community within a field that cares about computational issues, and relates to specific open-source software projects. For example, because of its focus on free and open-source tools, Neurohack week helps galvanize the Neuroimaging in Python (http://nipy.org) community.

- Interdisciplinary research: a short time-bounded event is an excellent opportunity to experiment with concepts, questions and methods that traverse boundaries within a discipline (e.g., between researchers using different methods, or studying different systems, or experimental models), as well as across disciplines. These experiments are often discouraged in traditional disciplinary research, because of the difficulty to achieve results in both disciplines, and because of the risks inherent in taking a less trodden path ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/12970550/), [ref](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8126355_EDUCATION_Risks_and_Rewards_of_an_Interdisciplinary_Research_Path)). This is despite the fact that interdisciplinary research can also be very impactful (XXX need examples, references). A diversity of research backgrounds, and interactions with scientists from other disciplines, further facilitates these experiments. The time-bounded nature of the hack week format mitigates some of the perceived risk of trying out mini-projects that are inherently more interdisciplinary.

- Recruitment: the close interaction with research trainees provides an opportunity to learn about their interests and their abilities in close quarters. This kind of extended opportunity for interaction and "on-the-job" testing is considered an excellent form of evaluation of prospective job candidates [citation needed], and a hack week provides an excellent opportunity to observe potential trainees in this manner. As an example, one of the participants in Neurohack week 2016 will be joining the eScience Institute as a post-doc in Fall of 2017 (and as an instructor in Neurohack week 2017).

- It's fun: the opportunity to focus for a week on a slightly more whimsical and adventurous sort of scientific activities can be both fruitful, and enjoyable.

### Audience and Participant Selection

Because hack weeks are at their core non-traditional workshop, it is worth thinking in detail about the target audience for a hack week, along with methods to select an appropriate group of participants. Here, appropriate essentially refers to 'most likely to achieve the stated goal of the hack week', though measuring that achievement remains a difficult issue itself. This is especially important because hack weeks, particularly in their more project-heavy iterations, are very participant-driven workshops. At a traditional conference or summer school, the programme will be largely set in advance by the organizing committee using the careful selection of speakers and lecturers. At a hack week much of the programme is in flux both before and during the workshop. In this context, a successful hack week requires participants who are both interested in participation and feel comfortable participating in discussions and taking risks. Therefore, a robust, effective participant selection procedure is of crucial importance to the outcomes of the hack week and may require both careful engineering and an in-depth discussion among the organizers.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the target audience for a hack week depends directly and very strongly on the stated goal (or mix of stated goals) of the workshop. Traditionally, at conferences, researchers report recent results to the community and network with other scientists largely from their discipline, leading to a fairly narrow target distribution in academic seniority and represented fields. At a summer school, the aim is generally for senior researchers to transfer knowledge about a particular subject or field to novice researchers, primarily graduate students and early postdoctoral fellows. Hack weeks differ broadly in two important ways: Firstly, because junior researchers are often more up-to-date on the latest technologies and methods, the focus on computational aspects implies that unlike at a summer school, junior participants are often more knowledgable about these topics than their more senior counterparts. Therefore, the seniority of researchers conducting hack week tutorials or who are generally brought in as experts skews younger than they would in a traditional summer school. Secondly, the goal of lateral knowledge transfer and interdisciplinary research implies that the audience for a hack week should be as broad as possible, since the potential for knowledge transfer is highest when the group is as heterogeneous as possible. A similar argument can be made for the goals of community building as well as disseminating new knowledge and best practices into communities. Accepting a set of participants that is diverse in both academic background and geographic location leads to both efficient knowledge transfer between communities that may otherwise remain siloed, and increases the chances that participants will take their newfound knowledge into their respective communities and spread it further.

Aside from these broad considerations, the tuning of the audience and participant selection will depend directly on several of the axes described in detail above. In particular, education-focused workshops might be more homogeneous than project-focused workshops, and similarly single-discipline hack weeks may be more homogeneous than interdisciplinary ones. Additional goals may be not directly related to the workshop itself, but on higher-order goals that a community might find desirable and that can be directly addressed by engineering the participant selection. For example, women are still a small minority in computational astrophysics. One goal of a hack week could be to increase the participation of gender minorities in computation-focused research. Similarly, if a particular sub-field within a discipline is ahead of others in their computational approaches, it might be worthwhile to engineer the mix of participants such that a number of experts from that sub-field are present. One interesting axis to consider is the mix of academics versus participants from industry. The latter may often be more focused on practically useful applications of methods and data sets, and can therefore provide an important counterpoint to more theory-focused academics. In particular in fields where the career path from academia to industry is less immediately obvious (as this the case e.g. in astronomy, where little directly relevant industry exists), inviting back participants who transitioned to industry successfully can provide important role models and networking opportunities for junior participants. Finally, with much of data science currently performed in the private sector, industry participants can bring directly relevant knowledge and new approaches to scientific problems to the table.

The need to carefully select participants dovetails with another requirement: transparency. Up to date, all hack weeks we have organized have been oversubscribed by at least a factor of two (IS THIS TRUE?), and thus necessarily require turning applicants away. The selection procedure should be as transparent to the applicants as possible, and the organizing committee should be held accountable for their performance. Transparency is necessary for applicants to understand acceptance/rejection decisions, and accountability is of crucial importance for the detection of inherent biases in the selection, which may harm both the workshop's success as well as the larger community.
Traditionally, both of these goals are unachievable, because participant selection happens by a committee of organizers, who read applications and form consensus based on individual judgments. This type of selection is impossible to do transparently, because much of it happens in the complex thought processes of the organizing committee's brains. It is similarly impossible to make the procedure accountable, because humans are prone to a-posteriori rationalizations of otherwise irrational decisions (REF?).

A natural solution of this problem is to remove the human element from the decision making as far as possible and giving the task to a well-designed algorithm. Here, well-designed refers to several properties: (1) it is interpretable, i.e. the algorithm, its parameters and outputs can be understood by humans, (2) it is openly available, and thus the decision process can be inspected, (3) the algorithm itself does not perpetuate intrinsic biases in the data (though we will show below that an algorithm itself does not entirely remove the requirement of humans to be aware of their biases).  

In practice, most selection procedures follow two separate steps, though in the case of human committees, these steps are often conflated. In the first step, the merit of a candidate must be assessed: does the candidate fulfill the requirements posed by the goals of the workshop? For example, at Astro Hack Week, it may be unrealistic to admit an undergraduate student in biochemistry, unless they had a compelling reason for attending. This first step is exceedingly difficult to automate, because it requires judgment calls, often based on long-form answers, that are as of yet difficult for computers to parse and classify. In the past, we have performed this step by blinding ourselves to a candidate's other attributes (including name and other personal information), and assess their candidacy based solely upon key questions asked specifically for this purpose.
When doing this procedure for a large enough sample, it is unlikely that the resulting pool of acceptable candidates is smaller than the number of available spaces at the workshop. The second step in the selection procedure thus requires tie-breaking between equally acceptable candidates. It is here where one may impose outside constraints on the selection based on the goals of the workshop. If multiple competing constraints are considered, this task essentially becomes a complex optimization problem, for which provably optimal algorithms exist that will far outperform any human selection procedure.

In particular, the software _entrofy_ ([source](http://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy)) employs one such algorithm and is capable of efficient selection of an optimal candidate set based on human target fractions. It is worth noting that this algorithm is vulnerable toward biases in two ways: firstly, humans will set the target fractions for any category of interest. If these targets reproduce the distribution of the overall sample of candidates, the selection will become essentially random. Any human biases involved in setting these target fractions will be perpetuated in the selection procedure. Secondly, perhaps more obviously, the algorithm can only act on information that has been collected. Biased participant sets may still result from selection procedures that fail to include crucial categories (for example, it would be difficult to produce a student-heavy participant set for a summer school if the algorithm has no information about academic seniority).

At Astro Hack Week, the goal of the selection procedure has always been diversity among several axes. This includes academic subdiscipline, to allow for maximally possible knowledge exchange between different fields within astronomy, as well as with researchers from adjacent fields including statistics, computer science and data science. Other important categories revolve around the participants' previous knowledge in terms of machine learning, statistics and programming. Unlike for a summer school, we have generally selected for a diverse set of participants in order to be able to efficiently pair up novices and experts in projects. Finally, we also include demographic information with two main goals: firstly, representation has been proven to be an effective way to foster an inclusive environment where minority participants feel comfortable to participate and take risks. Secondly, we would like to boost the participation of minority researchers in computational astrophysics, and Astro Hack Week provides a useful framework for doing so.  


### Themes

To date, all organized hack weeks have been subject-specific. That is, they aimed to bring together a community with a shared scientific interest, e.g.\ neuroscience or astronomy. This has several clear advantages. In particular, communities organized by subject generally share the same language, which drastically cuts down on the time participants spend simply agreeing on scientific terms. Similarly, the scientific objectives and questions are broadly clear to all participants: there is little need to explain in detail why a particular question may be of interest to the field. Finally, there are practical considerations: while even within fields the use of particular data sets and software packages may differ quite widely, there is generally a shared understanding of the type of data usually taken, and the most common ways to analyze this data. This leaves more time for active collaboration on cutting-edge science.

However, there are also drawbacks to limiting the theme of a hack week to a single field. Homogeneity may be a disadvantage if it leads to _group think_ and inhibits new, creative solutions. Within a field, the chance of participants being familiar with each other may be larger, leading to the formation of cliques and insufficient mixing. These disadvantages may be mitigated by organizing a hack week around a technique (e.g. Gaussian Processes) or modality (e.g. imaging) instead. In these case, building a shared vocabulary and understanding the major data analysis problems in each field is a crucial task, and should be allocated sufficient time in form of introductory talks or tutorials to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. On the other hand, cross-disciplinary hack weeks around a specific technique or type of data set allow methods developed in a specific field to diffuse into other subjects and therefore help avoid duplication of method development efforts.

An example of such events are the ImageXD (image processing across domains; [http://http://www.imagexd.org/](http://www.imagexd.org/)) meetings held at the UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science in the Summer 2016, and at the UW eScience Institute in the Spring of 2017. These three-day events also included a mix of tutorials, talks, and joint work on projects, but in contrast to the hack weeks described in the present paper, these events included participants from a variety of different research fields, with the common thread being that they all have an interest in the analysis of images, as part their research. Thus, audience and speakers included researchers from wide array of domains: astronomy, neuroscience and geosciences, but also material science, chemistry, biology, medicine, engineering, and others. In addition, participants included computer vision researchers, who develop algorithms that can be applied to answer scientific questions. Similarly, a series of events at UC Berkeley (Text XD) focused on the analysis of text data across different domains of research.

## Nomenclature

In recent years, the number of unconference-style meetings has steadily increased. Broadly, an unconference is any meeting that allocates significant time to participant-driven programme components such as tutorials, break-out sessions and discussions around a common topic. This is in contrast to more traditional conferences, which are generally dominated by pre-scheduled talks. In the latter case, information usually flows primarily in one direction, from speakers to the audience, and coffee and lunch breaks as venues for networking and exchange of information are often little more than an afterthought. At an unconference, most knowledge transfer is lateral, and generated during discussions and focused, collaborative project work.

Because unconference is such a broad term, it encompasses different interpretations favoured in various communities for a multitude of reasons Considerations include duration, focus on pedagogy and end goal. In particular, the term _sprint_ is often attached to software-focused events, where the goal is to improve specific pieces of code or conclude work on particular features. Prominent examples include **[add examples, e.g. scipy sprint day?]**, where open-source software communities gather to build on existing efforts, plan future work and recruit new developers for their projects. **[HOGG: You will want to disagree with me here, I think.]**

In contrast, hack days and hack weeks tend to be more open-ended and less software focused. Generally, the only rule is that there has to be a product at the end, with much leeway what that product may be. While some hackathons are organized around specific data sets or problems, acceptable outcomes often include visualizations, documents, twitter bots and other results not directly related to software. This generally allows for a higher degree of creativity and non-traditional approaches to problems. Here, length is an important factor determining the scope of what can be achieved: projects aimed to be completed within a single day or weekend will necessarily be smaller scoped than those to be completed in a week. Additionally, while sprints are generally focused on project work (and often run parallel to tutorials), in particular hack weeks allow for a mix of both. This, in turn, makes it possible and even desirable for participants to apply skills they have learned during tutorials right away, compounding the knowledge they have just gained.

It is worth noting that the term hackathon is disfavoured in some community, primarily because of the competitive aspect often found particularly in industry events, where teams actively compete for prizes. Because certain groups are more risk-averse than others, and risk-aversion traces demographics like gender, we urge caution when contemplating making an event competitive.

## Design considerations

Design considerations depend very strongly on goals. In general, longer events allow for a larger taught component, more ambitious projects and especially for cross-disciplinary events are more likely to provide enough time for different groups to effectively communicate across barriers of professional terminology. On the other hand, because of their large participatory component, hack weeks tend to be exhausting, and long events may lead to fatigue among attendees, where active participation and measurable outcomes may drop sharply in the latter days of the workshops. This is particularly important if---as is often the case---participants continue participating in workshop-relevant activities even after the official component ends for the day.

Ways to mitigate these effects include capping taught components during the day, providing a reasonable clear schedule, and limiting parallel components to avoid decision fatigue. At Astro Hack Week, we have limited the scheduled taught components to no more than three out of nine hours for each of the five workshop days, and unscheduled (shorter) tutorials to a maximum of two per day. Even so, participants occasionally report concerns about choosing to attend tutorials versus working on projects **[REF??]**.

Aside from time, space plays a particularly important role in facilitating a successful hack week. Universities in general provide a convenient venue with existing structures to facilitate hack weeks (e.g. access to scientific publications, institutional support including staff and funding). On the other hand, most spaces in universities are designed for lectures, which are diametrically opposed to unconference-style events. Thus, finding an appropriate physical space within a university may be a challenge. However, with the rise of active learning as a preferred teaching methods, traditional lecture spaces are transforming into more flexible spaces that are generally appropriate for hack weeks. As a general rule, the smaller a hack week's emphasis on a taught component, the more flexible the space has to be, with ample opportunity for re-configuration. At Astro Hack Week, we have found it beneficial to spend one day mid-week at a different location (e.g. a company headquarter) to engage participants and break the routine. It is worth noting that collaborative spaces for non-traditional workshops are becoming more prevalent in academia (some attached to universities, some not) and may provide support and infrastructure that a traditional university location may not (examples are the Lorentz Center in Leiden, the Aspen Center something or other, and **others**?).

Another important design consideration is group size. With all previous hack weeks severely oversubscribed, it seems natural to simply admit more participants. However, this can counter the ideals of the workshop, in particular when building a community is one of its stated goals. If the group is too large, participants are unlikely to even meet each other, and workshop cohesion may be lost as the workshop fractures into smaller groups, often among participants who already know each other. This may inhibit knowledge transfer by clustering participants into small in-groups. Additionally, it is likely that the number participant-led components in the schedule may increase with workshop size. While generally desirable, a programme that is too crowded may lead to fatigue On the other hand, if the size of the workshop is too small, it is unlikely to achieve the desired diversity among participants to foster new collaborations across sub-fields and disciplines. In the past, we have found groups with sizes between 50 and 70 participants to be large enough to encourage a breadth of projects while allowing the workshop to function as a cohesive group.

As mentioned above, the balance between pedagogy and working depends both on the goals of the workshop and the topics around which the workshop is organized. If participants have little shared knowledge, more teaching may be necessary in order to allow participants to effectively communicate with each other. In communities where a shared understanding exists, tutorials can focus on more advanced or innovative topics, and less time may be allocated for them, leaving more time for active participation. In astronomy, a relatively small field, even students generally share a common knowledge base and have rudimentary knowledge about the types of data used and the challenges associated with each. Thus, we have focused the taught component of Astro Hack Week less on domain-specific knowledge, and instead offered tutorials in topics from domain-adjacent fields like statistics and computer science that attendees are unlikely to have encountered in their regular education.

Hack week outcomes, in turn, depend strongly on participants and are often a function of their interests and seniority. A number of attendees arrive with the stated goal of writing a specific scientific article, though these tend to be more advanced participants with significant pre-knowledge of both hackathons and their topic of interest. Conversely, many attendees arrive with the stated goal of learning about a specific topic (such as machine learning) and bring a specific data set they believe the new knowledge may be applicable to. This leads to a wide variety of project types from sandbox-style explorations to focused work efforts. It is worth noting that while a scientific paper need not be the stated goal of a hack (and is unlikely to be completed in the short time allocated in any case), results may still be published as short reports or unconference proceedings. For example, Neurohack week provides a venue for participants to publish a short (two-page) "project report" summarizing the hack that participants did during the week of NHW. Similarly, Python in Astronomy gathers all documents produced during the workshop (unconference transcripts, talk summaries, descriptions of sprint and hack projects) into citeable unconference proceedings.

# Appendix

While the main text of this paper remains fairly theoretical, we aim to lay out more practical advice regarding the organization of a hack week in the appendix of this document.

### What to do before

#### Obtaining an IRB to track and study participants
For a large fraction of the hack weeks we have previously organized, studying the development of a hack week, its participants and outcomes was a stated goal of the workshop  **[GEO/NEURO: Is this true for you?]**. We included social scientists interested in scientific collaboration in the design process and organization, who both studied the workshop itself and gave valuable feedback about its outcomes. However, in order to be able to track and study participants, approval from Internal Review Boards is a must for workshops organized in the United States. This should be done as early as possible, and having assistance from researchers in the social sciences is invaluable, in particular for hack weeks in fields that generally don't involve human subject research. Ideally, participants should consent to be contacted at the application stage, which opens up the potential of tracking both participants and non-participants and allows for evaluation of the hack week.

#### Goal Planning
Unlike traditional conferences, where the programme is primarily driven by speaker selection, careful goal planning is essential for a successful hack week. The stated goals will continue to determine almost all of the remaining organizational questions, including space, participant selection and workshop evaluation. It is thus important for the organization committee to be well aware of what goals they pursue with the workshop. Is it aimed more at students or mature researchers, or a mix of both? Should the taught component dominate over project work or should it be only a minor programme point? Is the community to be invited more software-focused or should outcomes skew towards publishable results? Does the workshop aim to maximize its output by carrying best practices into universities and institutions that may be particularly underrepresented?
These questions, among others, should have a very clear answer before any further workshop organization takes place.

#### Hack Week Location
When considering space, both the broader location (city and country) as well as the specifics (the room the workshop will occur) should receive equal consideration. Students who depend on their supervisor's approval often report their superior's reluctance to fund travel to a non-traditional workshop, where they can gauge the outcomes for the students less than for a more traditional conference. Thus, keeping the costs of attendance low (including travel costs, room and board, and conference fees) should be the highest priority when deciding on a location. Conference centers like the Lorentz Center at the University of Leiden provide funding along with the collaborative space, but have long lead times when applying for their spaces (typically 12-18 months). The same can be true for collaborative spaces within universities and active learning environments, which tend to be popular. Therefore, the search for a location should commence no later than twelve months before the workshop, ideally much earlier.
The space itself should be large and ideally configurable, with moveable tables and chairs, several screens or projectors, and an ample number of white-/chalkboards. A useful guiding principle is to book a space that fits a group at least 25\% larger than that envisioned for the workshop, and the less configurable the space, the larger the extra room should be.

#### Funding

Closely tied to the issue of location is workshop funding. In principle, as little of the costs as possible should fall on participants, to widely enable participation especially for participants from institutions, countries and demographics that are generally underrepresented at other meetings. Locations that offer some funding or provide free space are preferable to those that do not.
At Astro Hack Week, we have found that travel grants are of crucial importance especially to undergraduates, students from minority backgrounds and participants from underrepresented countries. During the organization of Python in Astronomy 2017, we found that minority participants disproportionally decline to attend, and often cite lack of sufficient travel funding as the primary reason. In particular if increasing diversity in the more technical aspects of a field is one of the workshop's goals, providing enough travel funding for between five to ten participants can make a significant difference in allowing minority researchers to attend.

#### Code of Conduct

A hack week should have a code of conduct. Organizers should be aware that disparities in backgrounds, knowledge and experience, together with the close collaboration much of the hacking requires, makes for potentially treacherous grounds, especially when it comes to language. The goal of every hack week should be to provide a comfortable, inclusive environment for participants to learn and work, thus the organizing committee should discuss well in advance what belongs into the code of conduct. Additionally, we stress the importance of the organizing committee to discuss how to enforce the code of conduct, and play through different scenarios and their possible resolution in advance, in order to be prepared should a situation should arise in reality during the workshop.
A part of this could and should be the recognition that participants (and, indeed, members of the organizing committee) may occasionally violate the code of conduct in minor ways, and allow for tools and mechanisms to resolve these infractions. Major infractions, conversely, should be taken seriously and in severe cases lead to exclusion of participants.
Aside from important provisions banning discrimination on the basis of demographic characteristics, there may be domain- or workshop-specific clauses that may require recognition. For example, as communities move between programming languages or techniques, shaming participants for their choice of method or language should be strongly discouraged, since it will make participants feel unwelcome, defensive and inhibit learning on a larger scale.

#### Communicating with the Outside World

Because hack weeks have enjoyed considerable popularity, they have often been oversubscribed. This leaves with organizers with an important decision: given the necessity of turning a large fraction of applicants away, what methods does the group wish to employ in order to communicate during the hack week with the wider community not in attendance? Tutorials may be live-streamed via popular services such as youtube, but aside from the technical complexity of setting up a reliable live stream, their interactive format may not easily lend themselves to the one-directional communication of a video feed. Even so, live streams have proven to be both useful and popular in the past, but require considerable effort to set up. At the very least, there should be some method of communication with the in-group. Twitter has proven itself to be an effective medium of general communication with the wider community, including hack pitches, questions during tutorials and collaboration with researchers outside of Astro Hack Week. However, the closed nature of Twitter to those with an account may not make it the ideal platform for participation. Other open-source formats that do not require sign-up, such as Matrix, may be more compatible with the hack week format. Important documents such as programme (and especially programme changes) as well as hack descriptions should be open to the public and communicated clearly to facilitate collaborations with outside researchers.


### During a Hack Week

Unlike traditional conference, where the programme is generally set by pre-selected talks, hack weeks require additional involvement from the organization committee during the hack week itself.

#### Tutorials
Tutorials generally present themselves as one of the most useful components of a hack week, but also require careful preparation by both committee and speaker. In particular the mixed audience at a hack week, with beginners and experts in any given topic in the same room, necessitates planning. Because often, one of the primary objectives of a hack week may be community building, keeping the group together and focused on the tutorial is generally desirable.
There is reasonable a concern that long tutorials may separate the group into those who follow the tutorial in order to gain new knowledge, and those who already possess experience in the tutorial's topic and turn their attention to other subjects as the tutorial is ongoing. In practice, this concern can be mitigated by explicitly involving experienced participants in the tutorials. Teachers may call upon experts in the audience to identify themselves and effectively act as teaching assistants. This can be framed as advantageous for expert participants in terms of testing their own understand as well as improve their own skills in teaching the topic in question. This way, the concern of separating the group can be turned into a community-building exercise instead, a strategy that has proven successful at Astro Hack Week in several instances.
It is noteworthy that in practice, the mixed audience tends to lead to impostor syndrome among the speakers, who lose their explicit status as expert among the participants. It is therefore imperative that speakers are made aware very early about the audience so that they can plan their tutorial accordingly. It also helps to make them aware of the potential of using expert participants as teaching assistants during exercises and include them in the teaching, rather than see them as adversaries who may seek to correct them. Conversely, experts may be used to ask pointed questions about fundamental, important concepts, both in order to help the audience gain a deeper understanding and encourage questions especially from junior participants, who may be hesitant to ask questions due to their own impostor syndrome. At Astro Hack Week, we encourage the organizing committee and experienced participants to ask questions, particularly when they know the answer but think the concept may not yet be clear to parts of the audience. This has in the past led to exchanges between experts that have greatly contributed to the tutorials in ways that were both unplanned and unexpected for all involved, beginners and experts alike. Including experts in the teaching also takes pressure off teachers during exercises, when demands on the speaker are generally high. At Astro Hack Week, we have found that unexpected

The content and structure of the tutorials should generally depend on topic and audience. We explicitly call them *tutorials* rather than *lectures*, because the collaborative and hands-on nature of hack weeks lends itself more towards practical tutorials rather than more traditional, lecture-style knowledge transfer. That is in agreement with participant surveys, which show a preference towards hands-on exercises. In practice, it also limits the risk for fatiguing the participants with too much new knowledge. But this has several implications. First and foremost, it greatly reduces the amount of theoretical knowledge that can be imparted on any given topic. If teaching, say, machine learning would be difficult in one or two three-hour blocks, it is complicated even more so if a substantial fraction of those three-hour blocks is reserved for participants working on exercises. Tutorials at hack weeks therefore can never cover a topic thoroughly, and must remain fairly shallow introductions into subjects. Primary goals should be (1) to allow participants a first, practical exploration of the methods covered on their own data sets, and (2) provide an entry point for a more thorough study outside the hack week. This requires initial careful curation by the organizing committee, and close collaboration with the speakers in terms of what can and cannot be covered. In particular with speakers who may be foreign to the domain, this may also require in-depth communication about which particular methods or subjects could be appropriate and useful for the specific audience. In some cases, it may be advisable to recommend some theoretical texts as reading before attending the hack week, though it is likely that speakers should not count on every participant arriving with the same knowledge baseline. Because of their practical nature, however, software requirements should be announced as early and clearly as possible, with the expectation that participants will have installed necessary software in advance. It may be helpful to designate some time early on in the meeting to trouble-shoot installations before tutorials begin in order to avoid loosing significant time during the actual tutorials.

To summarize, a good tutorial will
* be very clearly tailored to the audience and narrowly scoped,
* strictly limit the amount of lecture-style teaching to less than 50\% ,
* use experts in the audience to ask key questions and act as teaching assistants during exercises
* communicate technical requirements at least a week before the hack week

#### Break-Out Sessions

It is almost impossible to organize tutorials that are so well-scoped that there is no mis-match between the tutorial content and the audience's immediate needs. Because speakers and organizing committee are unlikely to know in advance in detail what projects and data sets participants will bring, there is a high chance that there will be topics and methods brought up during the hack week that are of broad interest to the audience, but not covered in the pre-planned tutorials. Here, break-out sessions offer an alternative: short (30-45 minute) tutorials that are fairly spontaneously organized (with as little a lead time of a few hours) and often taught by expert participants in the audience. These tutorials can be a more in-depth treatment of one specific method of interest (e.g. Gaussian Processes, K-Means Clustering, Deep Learning), or cover a practical skill that may be useful to the audience, but is not formally part of the hack week (this is especially the case for skills related to software-development, such as code testing, documentation, profiling). They are generally more informal than tutorials and can be taught to a subset of the group rather than requiring all participants to attend.
Break-out sessions should be limited to one or two a day, in order to allow participants to attend break-out sessions without having to sacrifice a significant fraction of their time reserved for project-work. It is also possible to intentionally leave a tutorial slot free, to be filled with one or two self-organized break-out sessions instead of a pre-planned tutorial. In practical terms, it is advisable to keep a physical board with requests and potential teachers in a prominent location during the week. Decisions on which option to choose from the list can be done via an informal voting process, under the condition that a volunteer to hold the tutorial is found. Giving a break-out session can be a daunting task: while some experts may have relevant tutorials already prepared from other workshops, often it requires holding a thirty-minute talk with little to no preparation. Organizers can and should take steps to provide a positive, encouraging environment for participants to volunteer their knowledge. They should particularly encourage junior participants, who may often be the most knowledgable about the topics usually requested, to volunteer for break-out sessions. They provide a valuable teaching experience in a friendly environment and offer the opportunity of networking with the larger community.

To summarize, break-out sessions
* consist of short tutorials about a specific topic or practical skill not covered in the tutorials
* are more informal and may be taught to a subset of interested participants
* should be limited to 1-2 per day and no longer than 45 minutes to avoid conflicts with project-work
* can be daunting to teach, especially for junior participants, and requires the organizing committee to be pro-active about encouraging volunteer teachers

#### Hack Sessions

For hack weeks that place less emphasis on teaching, hack sessions are at the core of the workshop. They provide the opportunity for participants to actively collaborate and in many cases use the knowledge and skills learned in the tutorials on their own data sets. Even though hack sessions are strongly driven by the participants themselves, they require careful planning and vigilant supervision by the organizing committee. In general, hack sessions follow a standard pattern. In the initial stage, participants pitch projects to the group and in some cases request specific expertise (of a certain method, programming language or other skill). Ideally, the organizing committee will encourage participants to post potential projects as early as possible online in a central document, which will allow some organization even before the begin of the hack week. If the hack week admits very junior participants (e.g. undergraduate students or junior graduate students) it may be advisable for the organizing committee to contact experienced participants in advance and ask them to suggest hacks that are appropriate for those junior participants.
At the hack week itself, the time designated for project work will generally be prefaced by a pitch session, where participants with projects give a short description of their project to the group and request help. For junior participants and those new to the format, this can be daunting, even if (or especially when) they do not have a project themselves. In particular junior participants tend to believe that they do not yet have the skills to contribute meaningfully to any projects. Here, it can be useful to require those participants who are not pitching projects to state their expertise and affirm that every participant has expertise in something (the broad definition of hacking can help the organizers to be inclusive by allowing them to point out valuable skills such as writing, e.g. for tutorials and documentation, testing code to be released, etc.). After pitching, participants self-organize into teams to work on specific projects. Here, organizers should take care to remain aware of participants who may not have found a group, or are having trouble finding a task to work on. This remains true during the week, as some projects are abandoned and others appear. At least one member of the organizing committee should be familiar with the current roster of projects and the experience in the room to help match participants in case of need. Major ways to keep track of ongoing projects can be online, via real-time collaborative documents, as well as in the physical space, via a diagram of where in the space teams are located.
Because hack weeks are generally fairly long for the format (hackathons are often limited to just one or two days), this will lead to a variety of shorter projects completed within a day or two, and longer projects going on throughout the week. Regular check-in sessions are helpful for pitching new projects, requesting help on projects stuck at a certain point, and re-matching participants after hacks have been completed or abandoned. These sessions can also be used for completed hacks to be showcased, or intermediate achievements to be presented. Ample time should be reserved at the end of the week for a showcase of the week's projects. This showcase is perhaps one of the most important events of the workshop: it allows participants to present their results to the community, which can be confidence building especially for junior researchers. However, it is also important here to urge participants to present failed projects. The open-ended format of a hack week encourages experimental approaches and new directions, which necessarily will not all be successful. Too often, showcases focus on the most successful and impressive projects, which distorts reality and produces both an unreasonable expectation of what the result of a hack week ought to be as well as a pressure to be successful that can in practice inhibit participants. Therefore, it should be encouraged that participants show failed ideas, not least because the knowledge of why a project failed can be a valuable learning experience beyond the team working on that particular project.
