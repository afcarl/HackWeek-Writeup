### Executive summary

*put one-page summary here...*

## Why run a Hack Week?

- Something about informal education
- Peer learning
- At summer schools, the young learn from the old. At a Hack Week, the learning goes all ways.

### Objectives and goals
Teaching and working.
Recruiting?

### Audience
All the diversities.

### Themes
Organize around a subject (Astro) or a technique (Gaussian Processes) or a modality (imaging)?

## Nomenclature

- Hack week vs hack day vs hackathon vs. sprint vs ???
- focus on *who* is involved, degree of focus, importance of pedagogy, etc.
- Why are some words disfavored in some communities; implications of different terms.

## Design considerations

- Length of time
- Amount of time per day
- In the university or in the wild?
- Balance between education and working?
- Do you imagine people writing papers or playing in sandboxes?
- Do you imagine people doing many projects or just one?
- Balance between academics (say) and industry people?
- Balance between scheduled program and unconference breakouts?

## Participant selection

- THE most important part of the operation
- importance of open methods
- axes of diversity
- algorithmic selection

## Organizing a Hack Week

### What to do before

- WAY BEFORE: get IRB approval to track and study participants! This is a hard one, but very, very valuable.
- How to find the right space for a hack week
- Outcome planning
- Funding
    - Importance of (student) travel grants
    - Contemporary triviality of fundraising!
- Duration of event (since not all will be week long)

### What to do during

- Properties of a good tutorial / how to include expert participants in teaching
- Facilitating break-out sessions
- Facilitating hack sessions

### What to do after

- Follow-up survey and feedback
- Track publications and people
- Maintain email contact and build the hacking community.

## Measures of success

- See notes on IRB above; maybe expand on that here.
- How to evaluate a hack week?
- What are measures of success? How do we define success in the first place?

## Dos and Donts

- A place to put in small things that work or DON'T work.
- If something is a big point, it should get a section above.
- If something is a small point, it can live here in a grab-bag of points.

## Conclusions and Discussion
