All the diversities.

### Themes
Organize around a subject (Astro) or a technique (Gaussian Processes) or a modality (imaging)?

## Nomenclature

- Hack week vs hack day vs hackathon vs. sprint vs ???
- focus on *who* is involved, degree of focus, importance of pedagogy, etc.
- Why are some words disfavored in some communities; implications of different terms.

## Design considerations

- Length of time

- Balance between education and working?
- Do you imagine people writing papers or playing in sandboxes?
- Do you imagine people doing many projects or just one?
- Balance between academics (say) and industry people?
- Balance between scheduled program and unconference breakouts?
