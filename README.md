# HackWeek-Writeup

This repository contains our paper about hack weeks. The current draft (submitted to PNAS) is in `paper-pnas.tex`, 
and while some old versions exist in this repo, we strongly suggest you read that one.

You should be able to compile the draft using the `Makefile` simply by running `make`, or you can use your LaTeX 
installation of your choice to compile `paper-pnas.tex` manually.

There is some additional (unpolished and unpublished) material in `supplementary_material.tex`, which pertains largely 
to practical advice for hack week organizers. Feel free to look at that if you are interested in running a hack week.

Some data analysis and plotting code behind the results presented in the paper are located in `code/Analysis.ipynb`.
